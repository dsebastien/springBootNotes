# Deployment

## To the cloud

Spring Boot's executable JARs are ready-made for most cloud PaaS providers.

## OpenShift

Works by running scripts triggered by git commits. We can easily script the launching of a Spring Boot application as long aas the Java runtime is available.

Use the DYI cartridge \(https://www.openshift.com/developers/do-it-yourself\) and hooks in your repository under .openshift/action\_hooks
